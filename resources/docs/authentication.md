# Authenticating requests

Authenticate requests to this API's endpoints by sending a **`Heimdall-Key`** header with the value **`"{HEIMDALL_KEY}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You need to request an unique Heimdall key generation.
